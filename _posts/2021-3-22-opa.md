In this blog we are going to see an interesting project called Open Policy Agent, which allows us to define policy as code in a seamlessly way, we also going to work with rego files, which is the file that is used to evaluate a policy.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source project for declaring policy as code, using this tool we can allow or deny some action according our own rules (e.g: Deny kubernetes ingress controller creation if the image is not secure, Allow any http request for service A if Service B did the request, etc)
