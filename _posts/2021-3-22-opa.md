In this blog we are going to see an interesting project called Open Policy Agent, which allows to define policy as code in a seamlessly way, we also going to work with rego files, which is the file that is used to evaluate a policy.

## Open Policy Agent

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source project for declaring policy as code, thus we can allow or deny some action according to our own rules,
at the time of this writing  OPA supports many integrations such as kubernetes, istio, envoy, terraform, etc.
