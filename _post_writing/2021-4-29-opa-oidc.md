title: Open Policy Agent

In this blog we are going to talking about an interesting project called Open Policy Agent, which allows us to define policy as code in a seamlessly way, we are also going to work with rego files, which is the file that is used to evaluate a policy.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source project for declaring policy as code, using this tool we can allow or deny some action according our own rules (e.g: Deny kubernetes ingress controller creation if the image is not secure, Allow any http request for service A if Service B did the request, etc).


## Why do we need OPA?

In my case I use OPA for service-to-service authorization policy, this requirement could be easily done by the microservices itself but the drawback in doing this way is that we need to update this policy for every microservice, or even worse if our microservices are written in different languages the complexity is increased.

OPA solves this obstacle by providing us a tool that is language-agnostic and my opinion a simple way to define policies.


## Architecture

Internally OPA works with `rego` files which is used to define our policy rules and  `data.json` file wich is used as a datasource for compare any policy, the
policy and datasource is is against a input (http request, terraform command, etc)

OPA basically is deployed wether a centrally policy server where all components send a request to check if a current request is allowed or not; or as sidecar  component where is deployed next to our components.


### OPA as server policy

This kind of architecture is mostly used in scenarios where all of your components are in the same network or are very close to each other

Drawbacks with this architecture is that you have a single point of failure, if for any reason your opa server goes down all components that send check policy will be affected.

### OPA as sidecar policy

This is my favorite architecture because it solves the drawback of the opa server architecture, and the latency in a policy check is shorter than opa as a central server.

Drawbacks for this is that you need more resources because every opa will be present next to your component, thus if you have 10 microservices you will also have 10 opa sidecars.


## Let's practice

So far we have been talking about the theory, now is time to put in practice of what OPA can do.

### Create Policy

```go

package sample

import input.attributes.request.http as http_request
import data.services["service-a"] as service

default  allow=false

request = http_request
servicio = service
token = {"tipo": tipo, "payload": encoded} {
    [tipo, encoded] := split(http_request.headers.authorization, " ")
}

allow {
    is_token_valid
    action_allowed
}

is_token_valid {
  startswith(http_request.headers.authorization, "Basic")
}

action_allowed {
  http_request.method  ==  "GET"
  glob.match("/maestras**", [], http_request.path)
}
```

### Create datasource

opa datasource is flexible because is a json,

```json
{
  "services": {
    "service-a": {
      "services_security": [
        {
          "endpoints": [
            {
              "uri": "/api/v1/endpoint",
              "http_method": "POST",
              "allowed_callers_name": [
                {
                  "name": "postman",
                  "http_method": [
                    "GET"
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]

    }
  }
}
```

### Simulate a http input request

```json
{
  "attributes": {
    "destination": {
      "address": {
        "Address": {
          "SocketAddress": {
            "PortSpecifier": {
              "PortValue": 8000
            },
            "address": "172.19.0.3"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "request": {
      "http": {
        "headers": {
          ":authority": "localhost:8000",
          ":method": "GET",
          ":path": "/api/v1/endpoint",
          "accept": "*/*",
          "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
          "authorization": "Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=",
          "cache-control": "no-cache",
          "caller-name": "atla",
          "postman-token": "fc8a7b1c-4149-4fd5-bdf6-9c5183d6af09",
          "user-agent": "PostmanRuntime/7.26.8",
          "x-forwarded-proto": "http",
          "x-request-id": "1e47586e-7ec5-400e-b059-9ef299b2b0cc"
        },
        "host": "localhost:8000",
        "id": "15540377830434394261",
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/api/v1/endpoint",
        "protocol": "HTTP/1.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
### Test our policy

```bash
opa eval -d data.json -d ingress.rego --input input.json data.sample.allow
```
